# /diagnose — Root-Cause a Wrong or Failing Result

Find *why* an analysis errors, returns the wrong number, or won't reconcile — with a structured debugging loop rather than scattershot edits. Adapted from the `diagnose` pattern in [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills), reshaped for empirical research code where the bug is usually a *silent* wrong number, not a crash.

The discipline: **never edit before you can reproduce, and never fix before you can explain.** A guessed fix that makes the symptom disappear without a named root cause is how a wrong number gets *laundered* into a published table.

## When to use

- A regression / estimate returns a value you can't explain, or one that changed when nothing should have.
- A script errors out and the stack trace doesn't point at the real cause.
- A result "won't reproduce" — different number on re-run, on another machine, or after a package update.
- A replication claim fails `/audit-reproducibility` and you need to localize *which* step drifted.

**Diagnose is symptom-driven and single-target: ONE wrong number / ONE failing run.** Use a sibling instead when the job is different:

- [`/audit-reproducibility`](../audit-reproducibility/SKILL.md) — verify *all* numeric claims in a manuscript against current code (claim-driven, whole-paper). If you have one FAILing claim and want to localize which pipeline step produced it, `/audit-reproducibility` hands off *to* `/diagnose`; if you want to re-check every table number, start there.
- [`/review-r`](../review-r/SKILL.md) — code-quality review with **no specific symptom**.
- [`/capture-environment`](../capture-environment/SKILL.md) — snapshot the environment when version/seed drift is the suspect.

## Phases

### Phase 0 — Pin the symptom (expected vs. actual)

State the bug as a falsifiable gap before touching anything:

- **Expected:** the value/behaviour you believe is correct, and *why* (a prior run, a paper table, a hand calculation, a theoretical sign).
- **Actual:** the value/error observed now, copied verbatim (full message, not a paraphrase).
- **Tolerance:** the threshold that separates "same" from "different", keyed to the source of *expected* — prior run on the same machine → machine-epsilon + display rounding; a published table → rounding + small slack (~1e-3); a hand calculation → ~0.01; a theoretical prediction → an economic-significance band, not a decimal. Don't chase 1e-12 floating-point noise; don't wave away a 5% gap. (See [`replication-protocol.md`](../../rules/replication-protocol.md).)

If expected/actual can't be stated, the task is *understanding*, not diagnosis — stop and clarify first.

### Phase 1 — Reproduce deterministically (get a reliable red)

A bug you can't reproduce on demand can't be fixed, only hidden.

1. Fix every source of nondeterminism: set the seed, pin the working directory, record `sessionInfo()` / `pip freeze` / Stata `version` (lean on [`/capture-environment`](../capture-environment/SKILL.md)).
2. Re-run the smallest unit that exhibits the bug and confirm it fails **every time**. An intermittent failure is its own hypothesis (uninitialised RNG, order-dependent merge, race in parallel code) — note it and carry it into Phase 3.

### Phase 2 — Minimise to an MWE

Shrink until the bug sits in the open:

- **Data:** subset to the smallest rows/columns that still reproduce (often one group, one period, a handful of rows).
- **Code:** strip the pipeline to the shortest path from input to wrong output; comment out everything the symptom survives without.
- Each removal that *keeps* the bug is information; each that *kills* it is a stronger signal — record which.

The MWE is the deliverable even if the fix is later trivial: it's what makes the root cause undeniable.

### Phase 3 — Hypothesise (enumerate, then rank)

List candidate causes *before* testing any — a written list beats poking because it prevents fixating on the first idea. For research code, walk the usual suspects (all of these run cleanly with **no error message** — they are silent-wrong-number bugs):

- **Types & coercion** — a numeric read as character/factor; integer overflow; date parsed wrong; `TRUE/FALSE` ↔ `1/0`.
- **Missingness** — `NA` dropped silently, `na.rm` flipping a mean, listwise deletion changing the sample mid-pipeline.
- **Joins & shape** — a many-to-many merge inflating rows; duplicate keys; an unbalanced panel where balance was assumed.
- **Specification** — wrong clustering level, fixed effects absorbed twice, a lag/lead off by one.
- **Bad controls & colliders** — a control that is post-treatment, a mediator on the causal path, or a descendant of treatment (adding it *induces* bias, invisibly). The tell: a coefficient that moves the "wrong way" or shrinks implausibly when a control enters.
- **Numerical stability & convergence** — an optimizer that didn't converge (check the convergence code, not just the estimates), a singular/near-singular Hessian, collinearity (high VIF, a dropped column), tolerance set too loose, under/overflow with very small/large weights or coefficients.
- **Weighting & aggregation** — weights silently dropped/truncated, weights renormalised wrong, frequency vs. probability vs. analytic weights confused, a weight applied *after* rather than *before* a transform.
- **Sample** — a filter that runs before vs. after a transform; an outlier rule applied inconsistently.
- **Environment** — a package/Stata version bump that changed a default; a seed that moved; locale/encoding.

For a genuinely ambiguous bug, fan out the top competing hypotheses to parallel `Task` subagents (one per hypothesis, `context: fork`), each instructed to *try to confirm its own cause on the MWE* and report back — the loop-first analogue of asking three colleagues at once (see [`orchestrator-protocol.md`](../../rules/orchestrator-protocol.md)).

### Phase 3b — Reduce the hypotheses (so you don't launder a guess)

Each hypothesis (whether tested by hand or by a fan-out `Task`) returns `{hypothesis, evidence for, evidence against, confidence, one-line conclusion}`. Then:

- **One clear winner** (high confidence, others refuted) → proceed to Phase 4 to confirm the mechanism.
- **A near-tie** (top two within ~20 percentage points) → do *not* pick one; go to Phase 4 instrumentation to discriminate.
- **None above ~50%** → report ambiguity and ask the user; do not edit on a coin-flip.

### Phase 4 — Instrument & localize (bisect, don't stare)

Test the ranked hypotheses cheaply:

- **Bisect the pipeline** — check the intermediate value at the midpoint of the data flow; the bug is upstream or downstream of it. Repeat. Binary search finds the offending line in `log2(n)` steps, not `n`.
- **Bisect history** — if it "worked yesterday", compare against the last-good commit/output to pin the change that introduced it. (`git bisect` is fine here — it never discards work; the destructive git commands are blocked by `git-guardrails.py`, this is not one of them.)
- **Instrument with diagnostic primitives**, not guesses — at each stage inspect: `str()` / `summary()` for types & NA patterns; row & column counts *before and after* every transform; `table(factor)` to catch a silently dropped level; `cor()` / VIF for unexpected collinearity; weight diagnostics `range(w)`, `sum(w)`, `table(is.na(w))`; and the regression's convergence flag. **The stage where a count drops unexpectedly, a factor level vanishes, correlation jumps, or weights go sparse is the culprit stage.**

End Phase 4 with a one-sentence root cause naming the exact line/step and mechanism.

### Phase 5 — Fix & verify (then guard against regression)

**Confidence gate (the anti-laundering rule):** do not apply a fix unless the root cause is named **and** its mechanism is explicit. If Phase 3b left a near-tie, behave as `--no-fix`: report the candidates and ask. Editing research code on an unproven hypothesis is exactly the laundering this skill exists to prevent.

Unless `--no-fix` is set:

1. Apply the **minimal** fix at the root cause — not a downstream patch that masks it (prefer fixing the bad merge over filtering its duplicate rows afterward).
2. Re-run the MWE → confirm `actual == expected` within the Phase-0 tolerance.
3. Re-run the **full** unit and any dependent step → confirm the fix didn't move another number. If the result feeds a manuscript claim, re-check it (cross-ref the passport in [`/audit-reproducibility`](../audit-reproducibility/SKILL.md)).
4. Note a **prevention** — the assertion/check that would have caught this earlier. One concrete guard per bug class:

   | Bug class | One-line guard |
   |---|---|
   | Types & coercion | `stopifnot(is.numeric(x))` after read |
   | Missingness | explicit `na.rm = FALSE`; `stopifnot(sum(is.na(x)) == 0)` |
   | Joins & shape | record `nrow` pre-merge; `stopifnot(nrow(out) == nrow(left))` for a 1:1 join |
   | Weighting | `stopifnot(abs(sum(w) - 1) < 1e-8)` or `!anyNA(w)` |
   | Convergence | assert the optimizer/model convergence flag is OK before using estimates |
   | Sample | one explicit `filter()` with a stated reason, not a mid-pipe drop |
   | Environment | pin versions in `renv.lock`; `set.seed()` at the top of each script |

   Propose the guard; don't silently install a test suite.

With `--no-fix`, stop after the root cause is named and report it for the user to fix by hand.

## Worked example

A staggered-DiD `ATT` jumped from `−0.043` to `−0.071` after a data refresh; nothing in the spec changed.

```r
# Phase 1 — reproduce: set.seed(1); same script, same number every run. Red is stable.

# Phase 2 — MWE: one cohort, two periods still shows the jump.
#           Strip to: read panel -> merge covariates -> feols(). Bug survives the merge step.

# Phase 4 — instrument: row counts before/after each step
nrow(panel)                         # 12,400  (expected)
nrow(merge(panel, covars, by="id")) # 12,933  <-- inflated! a many-to-many merge

# Root cause: covars has 3 duplicate rows per id after the refresh; the join
# fans 12,400 -> 12,933, re-weighting the ATT toward the duplicated units.

# Phase 5 — minimal fix at the root (dedup the key), NOT a downstream row filter:
covars <- covars[!duplicated(covars$id), ]
# re-run: ATT back to -0.043 within tolerance; full pipeline re-checked, no other number moved.

# Prevention (Joins & shape guard):
stopifnot(nrow(merge(panel, covars, by = "id")) == nrow(panel))
```

## Output / report format

Write a short diagnosis to `quality_reports/diagnoses/YYYY-MM-DD_<slug>.md` (create the directory first: `mkdir -p quality_reports/diagnoses`). These reports may contain **real data values and file paths — they are project-internal and gitignored**, like session logs. Include:

- **Symptom:** expected vs. actual (+ tolerance).
- **MWE:** the minimal input/code that reproduces it.
- **Root cause:** the exact line/step and mechanism.
- **Fix:** the diff applied (or, with `--no-fix`, the recommended change).
- **Verification:** MWE + full-run re-check results.
- **Prevention:** the guard that would have caught it.

Plus a chat summary leading with the one-line root cause.

## Cross-language notes

The usual-suspects model is illustrated in R but the bug *classes* are language-neutral; the diagnostic idioms differ:

- **R** — `anyNA()` / `table(is.na(x))`; factors silently drop unused levels; `set.seed()`; `sessionInfo()`.
- **Stata** — `tab v, missing` and explicit `.`/`.a–.z` extended missing; `set seed`; `version`; weights as `[fw=]` vs `[pw=]` vs `[aw=]` is a frequent silent bug.
- **Python** — `df.isnull().sum()`; `numpy.nan` ≠ `None`; pandas vs numpy NaN handling differ; `np.random.seed()` / a passed `random_state`; `pip freeze`.

(Forkers in other fields: the five structural classes — Types, Missingness, Joins, Sample, Environment — are discipline-neutral; the econometric suspects above are the worked instance.)

## Exit behavior

| Outcome | Action |
|---|---|
| Root cause **NAMED** (high confidence), fix applied, re-verified | report root cause + diff + prevention |
| `--no-fix` | stop at a named root cause; write the report, make **no** edit to source |
| **Phase 0 blocked** (no statable expected/actual) | halt, ask for the expected value — diagnosis needs a target |
| **Phase 1 blocked** (cannot reproduce / nondeterminism) | report the nondeterminism *as* the finding (it is the bug class) + how to make the analysis deterministic; do not edit blindly |
| Phase 3b **near-tie / <50%** | report the competing hypotheses and ask the user; do not apply a fix |

## Flags

- `--no-fix` — Diagnose only: run through naming the root cause (Phases 0–4) and write the report, but make **no** edit to source. Use when you want to apply the fix yourself, or when the file is shared/load-bearing and an automated edit is inappropriate.

## What this skill does NOT do

- **Review code with no symptom** — that is [`/review-r`](../review-r/SKILL.md). Diagnose needs an expected-vs-actual gap to chase.
- **Re-audit every claim in a paper** — that is [`/audit-reproducibility`](../audit-reproducibility/SKILL.md). Diagnose fixes one bug deeply.
- **Build a test suite** — it proposes the single guard that would have caught *this* bug; standing test infrastructure is separate dev work.
- **Commit the fix** — branching / committing is [`/commit`](../commit/SKILL.md)'s job.
