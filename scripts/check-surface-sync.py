"""
Check cross-document count consistency for the template's public surfaces.

Prevents the drift pattern that hit PRs #70, #76, #78 — where adding a skill
(agent, rule, hook) updates `.claude/` but leaves stale counts in README,
CLAUDE.md, the guide source, the rendered guide, or the landing page.

Two kinds of check:
  1. COUNT assertions — prose like "13 agents, 27 skills, 21 rules" must
     match the on-disk inventory (the original check).
  2. TABLE-ROW assertions — an enumerative markdown table preceded by a
     `<!-- surface-sync-table: <kind> -->` marker must have exactly one
     data row per item of <kind> on disk. This catches the drift the
     count check misses: e.g. the v1.5.0 peer-review trio that was added
     to `.claude/` but left OUT of the README/CLAUDE.md skills tables for
     three releases (the counts were right; the table rows were stale).

Run via `./scripts/check-surface-sync.sh` pre-commit, or `/commit` will
invoke it automatically.

Exit codes:
    0 — all counts consistent
    1 — drift detected (prints a diff)
    2 — internal error (missing surface file, unreadable directory)
